                        The Ellen Fund, established by Ellen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi, was dedicated to supporting global conservation efforts, with a particular focus on protecting endangered species and their habitats. The fund aims to raise awareness and mobilize resources for critical conservation projects around the world. One of its flagship initiatives includes the establishment of a sustainable 12-acre campus in Rwanda, dedicated to gorilla conservation and training the next generation of African conservationists. Through strategic investments, high-profile partnerships, and impactful media projects, including the production and release of a high-level film on Discovery, the Ellen Fund strives to make a significant impact on wildlife preservation and environmental sustainability.
                        <br /><br />
                        Telea Insights launched the Ellen Fund by developing the mission, funding priorities and key communications for the Ellen Fund and managed it from its inception to its successful conclusion, securing $11 million for global conservation efforts. We supported the establishment of a sustainable 12-acre campus in Rwanda, dedicated to gorilla conservation and training future African conservationists, which attracted over 50,000 visitors in its first two years. Additionally, we oversaw strategic planning, operational execution, and the eventual wrap-up of the organization. There were significant benefits felt by the 2,400 member construction team, including certification for new construction skills, ongoing employment even after the Ellen Campus construction concluded, and personal savings.  The Ellen Fund led the impact campaign for the film Ellen DeGeneres narrated titled Endangered, which deployed $1 million to conservation initiatives around the world including conservation for sharks, lemurs, Indonesian songbirds, frogs and clouded leopards. Our comprehensive management ensured the Ellen Fund's lasting impact and legacy, including the seed funding of a Rwandan film production company that grew to a 10-member team. One of the key highlights of our collaboration was the production and release of a powerful film on Discovery, which captivated a wide audience and significantly heightened awareness of critical conservation issues. This media project expanded the Ellen Fundâ€™s reach and also amplified its mission to protect endangered species and their habitats on a global scale.
